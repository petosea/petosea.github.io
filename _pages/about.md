## I. Introduction

I am **He Zhengyang**, a Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests focus on ultra-precision manufacturing equipment, under the supervision of Prof. Tong Zhen. I received my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Sichuan University.

Beyond my primary research in mechanical systems, my scholarly interests span multiple disciplines, allowing me to maintain a comprehensive perspective on contemporary scientific and technological developments. This website serves as a repository for my research notes, technical documentation, and public materials on subjects within my areas of expertise.

For questions, suggestions, or just to chat about shared interests, feel free to reach out at [Z.Y.HE@sjtu.edu.cn](mailto:Z.Y.HE@sjtu.edu.cn). I would be happy to hear from you.

## II. Repository Contents

This repository is organized into the following sections, reflecting the interconnected nature of knowledge, technology, research, and engineering practice:

### 📚 Knowledge
Knowledge is a systematic endeavor to explain the world and ourselves, addressing the fundamental question of "why." This section contains study notes and materials across multiple disciplines:
- **Philosophy & Natural Sciences**: Foundational theories in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and system science
- **Social Sciences**: Materials on economics, management, policy, and organizational systems
- **Formal Sciences**: Mathematical frameworks and their applications to various domains
- **Systems Science**: Cross-disciplinary perspectives on complex systems and their interactions

Knowledge forms the theoretical foundation upon which technology and engineering are built.

### 💻 Tech-Stack
Technology answers the question "how to solve problems" through systematic methods and approaches. This section documents practical implementations and tools:
- **Programming Languages & Frameworks**: Languages, libraries, and frameworks I have worked with
- **Software Development Tools**: Development environments, version control, and deployment systems
- **Technical Methodologies**: Best practices and design patterns for solving engineering problems
- **Technical Documentation**: Applied technical knowledge encapsulated for direct use

Technology bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, enabling problem-solving without requiring deep mastery of underlying theory.

### 🔬 Research
Research drives innovation through problem-oriented inquiry, addressing gaps in both knowledge and practical solutions:
- **Knowledge Research**: Investigating unanswered "why" questions through theoretical analysis and experimentation
- **Technical Research**: Developing new methodologies and approaches to solve practical "how" problems
- **Research Papers & Findings**: Academic work documenting novel discoveries and solutions
- **Problem Analysis**: Documentation of research methodology and findings

Research represents the systematic pursuit of new knowledge and technical advancement.

### 🔧 Engineering
Engineering integrates existing knowledge and technologies to create practical solutions at scale:
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Design and optimization of mechanical systems and ultra-precision equipment
- **Systems Integration**: Approaches to combining multiple technologies for coherent solutions
- **Technical Projects**: Applications of engineering principles to real-world problems
- **Solution Architecture**: Design and implementation of integrated technical systems

Engineering represents the highest form of cultural practice—the systematic application of knowledge and technology to transform the world.

### 📄 CV
A comprehensive curriculum vitae detailing my educational background, research experience, technical skills, and academic achievements.
